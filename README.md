**1) INVESTMENT ASSIGNMENT** :  Spark Funds, an asset management company wants to make investments in a few companies. Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:
- It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
- It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in.

**Objective**: The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.
 
**2) CASE STUDY[Lending Club]** : A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

**Objective**: The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default

**3) CAR PRICE PREDICTION**: A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
- How well those variables describe the price of a car

**Objective**: Build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of car prices with the available independent variables
